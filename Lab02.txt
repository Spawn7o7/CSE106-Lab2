				<h3> Enjoy Your Journey into the 'Rabbit Hole' </h3>
				<p> Are you a passionate fan of literature, movies, TV shows, or video games? Do you find yourself endlessly fascinated by the
				intricate details that bring fictional characters to life? Or maybe you just stumbled across this site on accident. Regardless
				be prepared for a sleep-deprived ramble regarding my own niche interests and comfort characters.</p>

				<p> <span>&#128373 </span> <i>Character Design Exploration:</i> We leave no stone unturned in scrutinizing the design choices that breathe life into characters.
				From the subtlest costume details to the broad strokes of visual representation, we uncover the artistic decisions that make
				characters iconic.</p>
				
				<p> <span>&#128218 </span> <i>Character Arc Investigations:</i> Characters are the beating heart of every story, and their evolution is a narrative dance of
				growth and transformation. Join us as we dissect character arcs, exploring the emotional and psychological journeys that make
				characters resonate with audiences. </p>
				
				<p> <span>&#x1F50D </span> <i>Symbolism Unveiled:</i> Beneath the surface of every great story lies a web of symbolism, waiting to be uncovered. We unravel
				the hidden meanings, metaphors, and allegories that enrich the worlds we love, shedding light on the deeper messages authors and 
				creators embed in their creations. </p>
				
				<p> <span>&#129303 </span> <i>Join the Discussion: </i> We're not here to provide all the answers; we're here to start conversations. Engage with our community of 
				fellow enthusiasts, share your insights, and ignite debates about the characters and stories that have captured your heart. </p>

				Rabbit Hole welcomes you to a place where we celebrate the magic of fiction through over-analysis and deep exploration.</p>
				
				<p>So, sit down and buckle up because I'm going to take you on a journey through the my current brainrot characters, who I enjoy a <i> healthy </i> 
				amount. Is this cringey? Maybe. But honestly, it seems like a fun topic to ramble about.</p>

				<h1> About Me </h1>
				<ol>
					<li> I have way too much freetime on my hands </li>
					<li> I spend an unnecessary amount of time analysing fictional characters and their story arcs </li>
					<li> After reading this 'blog' you will notice I fall into the CSE stereotype of being a huge nerd </li>
					<li> To save time some of the text shown in the website is AI generated (like the home page summary). But 
					all code is hand-written</li>
					<li> Some images were crappily and hurriedly drawn by me in MS paint, I'm a decent artist I swear...</li>
					<li> I lowkey complicated this entire process but I had fun, at the moment of writing this I'm about 9 hours 
					into coding</li>
