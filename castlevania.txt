				<h1>Castlevania: An Analysis of Dracula</h1>
				<p> </p>
					<p class="ctext"><i>Written in honor of the release of "Castlevania: Nocturne" on September 18, 2023</i></p>
				<p> </p>
					<p> Inspired by the popular video game by Konami, the Netflix anime adaptation is a dark medieval fantasy. 
					It follows the last surviving member of the disgraced Belmont clan, Trevor Belmont, trying to save Eastern Europe 
					from extinction at the hands of Vlad Dracula Tepes. Unlike many other tv shows that introduce the protagonist first, 
					the show instead begins with an introduction of Dracula and a human doctor name Lisa. She approaches his intimidating castle and 
					softly demands that he teach her about science and technology to better her medical practices. Dracula of course tries to scare her away 
					but Lisa is resilient and critiques his terrible ettiquete as a host. The scene ends with Dracula smiling, it seems he may like this human.</p>

					<p> The episode continues with a timeskip, this time we see an older Lisa tied at the stake in a church. She is on trial for being a witch 
					and heretic (which of course is false, but the church had discovered scientific equipment at her home). As she burns, she yells to the sky calling 
					out to forgive these people, the onlookers and priests do not know the grave error they have committed. As she dies, the flames erupt into 
					the face of Dracula; he curses at the crowd, how dare they condemn an innocent woman? His wife? He warns the town of Targoviste, in a year's time
					he will return with an army from hell and receive retribution. His care for humanity died with his wife, Lisa had taught him that not all humans 
					were bad, but she was mistaken. His son, Adrien 'Alucard' Tepes confronts him later that day, he says he grieves with his father but he cannot allow him 
					to exterminate an innocent town of people. Its not what his mother would have wanted. Instead, he suggests to find the person who convicted her and enact 
					revenge on them instead. "There are no innocents! Not anymore! Any one of them could have stood up and said, 'no, we won't behaving like animals anymore." 
					Dracula blinded by rage and grief attacks his son, forcing Alucard to hide away for a year to recover from his wounds.</p>

				</writing>
					<p>The first two seasons focus on the protagonist's (Trevor, Alucard, and Sypha) adventure to try and stop Dracula and his horde of demonic creatures. 
					Trevor the primary protagonist is a reluctant hero. Coming from a long line of monster hunter's he is the only person equipped with the knowledge and tools 
					to vanquish Dracula. But he shares a similar disdain to humanity as the villain, his family was exiled and murdered by the Church for being 'heretics.' 
					Going back to Dracula, as the series progresses he slowly loses the fiery passion for killing humanity that he originally had. Once the protagonists reach 
					his castle in season 2, he is a husk of his former self. Dracula still looks like the intimidating 9' tall creature of the night, but he just misses his wife. 
					His extermination of the human race is no longer something he is passionate about, it just seems like an obligation to complete. As Alucard puts it this massacre 
					has been nothing but history's longest suicide note. I won't say much more to prevent myself from spoiling this show for you, but I highly recommend it for the rich 
					story and beautiful animation.</p>
