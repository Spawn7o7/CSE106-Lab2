		<h1> A Deep Dive into Masked Characters</h1>
		
		<p>In the vast realm of fiction, masks are not just mere accessories; they are 
		powerful symbols of secrecy, identity, and psychological depth. Whether worn by heroes, 
		enigmatic antiheroes, or mysterious villains, these masks hold a multitude of meanings. 
		In this article, we peel back the layers of masked fictional characters, delving into the

				<p><i>Wrench:</i> He is a hacktivist from the 2018 video game <i>Watch dogs 2</i> created by Ubisoft. 
				He has a wild and humorous personality. But is prone to some violent outbursts. According to an in-game 
				audio log, the FBI developed a psychological profile of him and determined him to have a troubled, possibly 
				traumatic childhood. As such, he is socially awkward around women, has trouble conveying his emotions, and 
				wears his trademark mask as a "billboard" to show how he feels.</p>
				<p class="spacing"> </p>
				<p><i>Ghostface:</i> This name is a famous moniker for the killers in the Scream horror movie franchise. 
				There is nothing symbolic in wearing this particular mask, it simply serves the purpose of hiding the identity 
				of the person wearing it.</p>
				<p class="spacing"> </p>
				<p><i>Winter Soldier:</i> The Winter Soldier is a prominent character in Marvel's comics and movies. The character 
				was a villain in his first appearance. His character was brainwashed and used as a super-soldier weapon for an evil
				organization. In his first scene, he has no visible expressions and he doesn't speak. Because of this, he is effectively 
				dehumanized and characterized through his actions, and he moves to kill. He's seen as a weapon, not a person. The mask acts 
				almost like a muzzle.</p>
